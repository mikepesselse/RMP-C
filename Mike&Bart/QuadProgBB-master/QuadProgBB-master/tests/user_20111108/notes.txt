In run3, we see that the GUB is now stable. But the problem still takes
a long time for branching with lots of poorly solved nodes.

A check file from that run has been saved.

In output.txt, the problem looks likes its solving fine, and it gets
the gap down to around 0.008%. Then, all of a sudden, it finds a much
better GUB, which is beyond the current GLB (a contradiction!) and all
remaining nodes are fathomed.
